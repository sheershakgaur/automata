# automata
Automata coding assignment
This repository contains a methodology on how to convert a context free grammar to respective push down automata.
The author of this project is E19CSE389, Sheershak Gaur of team Startle.
In this project we will assume that the grammar is in GNF form, we will input a grammar from the user in a certain format. There are many default cases when the user can provide a wrong input. We will then compute the grammar to pda and print the pda.
